   as below is how to view the actual page that we have created;
2. From the URL link on top of the page (Image as reference)

   type on the end of the URL either "/MahasiswaServlet" to see the mahasiswa data page or you can also type "/MataKuliahServlet" to access the mata kuliah data page
   
* If you typed "/MahasiswaServlet on the end of the URL, you will be redirected to this page:

* Otherwise, if you entered "/MataKuliahServlet" instead, you will be transported to this landing page:

3. After entering your desired URL (Say MahasiswaServlet for example), and you want to add a student:

   * Navigate towards the blue botton as shown in image

* the "Edit" button functions as a button to edit the data of the mahasiswa
* clicking the "Hapus" button will give you a confirmation pop-up as the action causes it to delete a mahasiswa
* the "FRS" button will lead you to a different page, it is a page to assign students with courses; more specifically as shown below
